The input source list need to be in the format:

ID RA Dec major_diam minor_diam PA type

major_diam and minor_diam are in arcmins

I remember encountering a few bugs, so don't be surprised if you all meet some. 

#### To make jpg from fits. You'll need to do it before qa

glga_make_jpg_set

* You may want to modify it a bit, ask it take the source list, not id and ra
* Look into the code and you'll know what I am talking about. 

#### To mask, adjust aperture, measure 

glga_qa, file, ......

/nobrowse : add this keyword to edit. 
annuli_size = ? : in arcsec. step size of photometry annuli. Default=6 (I think)
/skip : skip galaxies which are finished
start =?  :  Number of name . Start the list from the designated galaxy.
/sdss, /galex, etc : which survey images are you working on

 ### To play with glga_qa:
 (f) find stars (point source)
 (r) manually mask out regions
 (d) delete stars
 (m) measure profiles. You would like to do this after masking. It makes some B/W images which are easier to check visually than the color image. It also make plots of surface brightness profiles. 
 (k) kill all stars
 (e) adjust ellipse 
 (h) help 
 (q) finish the galaxy, move to next
 (Q) quit glga_qa
 
 ### In (e), adjust ellipse. You would like to do this before putting all the masks, otherwise it would be slow
 (z) shrink
 (x) expand
 ([,]) change axis ratio
 (w,s,a,d) move up, down, left, right
 (r) re-center with mouse
 (c) cancel all modification
 * note that once you make the adjustment, it will be recorded and next time the glga_qa will read the file, use the new ellipse.

 ### After (q), you may give some flags, which can be called later to remind yourself what's happening there. Especially the (F) flag, in that way, you can ask glga_qa to skip galaxies with (F) flag next time.

#### Only measure the profile 

glga_batchprofile

* keywords are similar to glga_qa
* You may want to modify it a bit, ask it take the source list, not ra, dec, etc.
* Look into the code and you'll know what I am talking about. 

#### Only plot the profile

glga_batchplots, file,  .........

file : input source list

#### To get products (photometry, plots, images......) in one place

glga_deliver, file, ......

/photometry : ascii photometry files
/plots : surface profiles plots
/aux   : auxillary file, including masks, ellipse, etc
/jpg   : all jpg files, including images, profile plots
/qa    : relevant file created by in glga_qa
/images : color images of galaxies
/galex, /sdss, etc : the survey image you want

#### Where are all the outputs? 

There are under data/XXXD/
